## GitHub Sync Troubleshooting

If you see a message saying the repository **already exists** but you cannot find it:

### 1. Check for Private Repositories
By default, auto-generated repositories may be set to **Private**.
- Go to [github.com/repositories](https://github.com/settings/repositories) while logged in.
- Use the search bar to look specifically for `studio`.
- Ensure the "Type" filter is set to "All" or "Private".

### 2. Use the Source Control Sidebar
1. On the far left vertical bar of this editor, click the **Source Control icon** (it looks like three connected circles).
2. If the project is connected, you will see a **"Sync Changes"** or **"Publish Branch"** button.
3. If it says "Initialize Repository", the connection might have been interrupted. Click it to start the process again.

### 3. Failsafe: Command Palette
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac).
2. Type **"GitHub"**.
3. Select **"GitHub: Publish to GitHub"** or **"GitHub: Sync"**. This often forces the UI to refresh its connection state.
