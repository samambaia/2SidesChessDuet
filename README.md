# 2ides Chess

A professional, modern chess experience built with Next.js, Firebase, and Genkit.

## How to Sync with GitHub

If clicking the project name at the top opens a rename dialog instead of a menu, please use one of these alternative methods:

### Option A: Use the Command Palette (Most Reliable)
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac).
2. Type **"GitHub"** in the search bar that appears at the top.
3. Select **"GitHub: Connect to GitHub"** or **"Publish to GitHub"** from the list.

### Option B: Sidebar Icon
1. Look at the vertical bar on the far left of the screen.
2. Click the **Source Control icon** (it looks like three circles connected by lines).
3. Look for a button that says **"Publish to GitHub"** or **"Initialize Repository"**.

### Option C: Precise Breadcrumb Click
1. Look at the top-left breadcrumb: `Firebase Studio > ChessDuet`.
2. Try clicking specifically on the **Chevron symbol (`>`)** between "Firebase Studio" and "ChessDuet" to see if it reveals the project menu.
